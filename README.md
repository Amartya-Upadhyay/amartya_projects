# Data-Analytics-Projects:

### Project 1: Explore Weather Trends with weather forecast data 
In this project, I choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and pandas.
I complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing the findings. 

### Project 2:  Investigate a dataset called TMDb movie data.
I was provided a dataset reflecting data collected from an experiment. I used statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and report my conclusions and recommendations in a report.

### Project 3: Analyze A/B Test Results with company ab_data.csv 
Using Python, I gathered data from a variety of sources, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. I documented the wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python and SQL.By using AB Testing and regression methods to decide if the company should launch a new webpage or keep the old one. 

### Project 4 :  Data Wrangle and Analyze with Tweet WeRateDogs data
Collect data from different sources and assess data visually and programmatically , clean data for visulizing data and finding insights later. 

### Project 5: Data Visulization with Diamond Data 
Data visualization to a dataset involving the characteristics of diamonds and their prices.

### Project 6: Communicate data finding with Ford Go Bike Sharing Data
In this project, I used Pythonâ€™s data visualization tools to systematically explore the bike dataset for
its properties and relationships between variables. Then, I created a presentation that communicates the findings to others.
